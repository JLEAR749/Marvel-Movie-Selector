# Guide 

## Description

As new developers, we want to practice and showcase our new knowledge of APIs using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

We want to make it easier for people to decide what movies to watch.

Information about movies are scattered across multiple websites.

We want to consolidate that information in one place, on our webpage. 

## Usage

If you want to find information about a movie,
then navigate to the URL of our webpage, **WEBSITE URL GOES HERE**
then type the movie title into the search bar and press enter or click "search".
Then the page will display **!@#$%& EDIT THIS LATER >>>> !@#$%^** critic reviews, a movie poster, the actors **!@#$% <<<<< EDIT THIS LATER !@#$%**

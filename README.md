## Project Title 

NBA-Fantasy-Basketball

## About

As new developers, we wanted to showcase and practice our skills by creating a website that utilizes the programming languages we've been learning. To do this, we decided to create a website for users that play in fantasy basketball leagues. It utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript and Semantic-UI to give statistics that will help users gain a competitive edge in their fantasy leagues. 

## Key Features

-Search bar
-3rd party APIs give up-to-date statistics about basketball players
-Persistent memory storage between browser sessions
-Displays your search history to makes it easy to keep track of what players are in your roster
